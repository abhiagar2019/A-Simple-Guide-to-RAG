      "Climate change significantly affects polar bears, primarily through its impact on their sea ice habitat. As global temperatures rise, Arctic sea ice is melting at an alarming rate, which is critical for polar bears for several reasons:\n",

      "1. **Habitat Loss**: Polar bears rely on sea ice as a platform for hunting seals, their primary food source. As the ice melts, bears have to travel greater distances to find food, which can lead to malnutrition or starvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Breeding and Denning**: Female polar bears typically build maternity dens on stable sea ice or on land where conditions are suitable. Warmer temperatures and irregular ice patterns can disrupt the timing of den construction and affect cub survival rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increased Competition**: As ice diminishes, polar bears may encounter increased competition for food, particularly in areas where their ranges overlap with other bear populations or where seals are less available.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Health and Reproduction**: The stress of longer fasting periods and reduced access to food can lead to poorer overall health, lower cub survival rates, and reduced reproductive success in female bears.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Human-Bear Interactions**: As polar bears are forced to travel further inland in search of food, they may come into closer contact with human settlements, leading to increased conflicts and negative outcomes for both bears and people.\n",
