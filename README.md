 Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, stands as a pivotal technique shaping the landscape of the applied generative AI. A novel concept introduced by Lewis et al in their seminal paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401), RAG has swiftly emerged as a cornerstone, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness in the outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs)

About the book
---
This book is a foundational guide designed particularly for beginners looking for an easy, yet comprehensive introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation. This book does not go deep into the technical nitty-gritties of RAG rather provides an overview. Data Scientists, Data Engineers, ML Engineers, Software Developers, Technology Leaders, Students and Academicians interested in generative AI powered application development will find this book valuable. Upon completing this book, you can expect to:

- Develop a solid understanding of RAG fundamentals, the components of a RAG enabled system and its practical applications.

- Know what a non-parametric knowledge base for RAG means and how is it created.

- Gain knowledge about developing a RAG enabled system with details about the indexing pipeline and the generation pipeline.
- Gain deep insights into the evaluation of RAG enabled systems and modularised evaluation strategies

- Familiarize yourself with advanced RAG strategies and the evolving landscape

- Acquire knowledge of available tools, technologies and frameworks for building and deploying production grade RAG systems

- Get an understanding of the current limitations of RAG and an exposure to popular emerging techniques for further exploration

__Note: This book is still in development and is scheduled to be completed in the next few months__

Code Snippets are organised in the Chapters Directory by [Chapters](./Chapters)



- Chapter 1 - Does not have any code

- Chapter 2 - Does not have any code

- [Chapter 3 - This notebook](./Chapters/Chapter-03/indexing_pipeline.ipynb) outlines the indexing pipeline. 

    A knowledge base is created for the 2023 Cricket World Cup based on the Wikipedia Article on the topic. We use __AsyncHtmlLoader__ and __Html2TextTransformer__ to load the article, chunk the text using __RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter__, use __text-embedding-3-large__ from OpenAI to convert chunks into vectors and use __FAISS__ as the vector index to store the embeddings.

- [Chapter 4 - This notebook](./Chapters/Chapter-04/indexing_pipeline.ipynb) outlines the generation pipeline. 

    We use the knowledge base created in Chapter 03 on the wikipedia article on 2023 Cricket World Cup. We load the __FAISS__ index and use the __similarity search__ function to retrieve chunks. We then Augment the user query with the retrieved chunk and use __GPT 4o__ model from OpenAI to generate the response.

    This notebook also includes functions that can be used to generate answers for different queries that a user may want to ask.

    Additionally, this chapter contains [another notebook](./Chapters/Chapter-04/xtra_tfidf_bm25_retriever.ipynb) that shows the usage of TF-IDF and BM25 as retriever algorithms.

- [Chapter 5 - This notebook](./Chapters/Chapter-05/rag_evaluations.ipynb) evaluates the RAG pipeline created in chapters 3 and 4 using the __RAGAS__ framework.

    Additionally, this chapter includes a [notebook](./Chapters/Chapter-05/xtra_benchmarking.ipynb) that uses LangChain Benchmarks to benchmark our RAG pipeline on LangChain QnA docs.

- [Chapter 6 - This notebook](./Chapters/Chapter-06/advanced_rag.ipynb) demonstrates selected Index Optimization, Query Optimization, Retrieval Strategies and Post Retrieval Compression techniques.

__Note: This is a WIP repository and subsequent chapters will be released on an ongoing basis__

Setup
---

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/abhinav-kimothi/A-Simple-Introduction-to-RAG.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository:

    
    cd A-Simple-Introduction-to-RAG

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide Python packages.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment named myenv (you can name it anything you like):

```
python3 -m venv .myenv
```
Activate the Virtual Environment:           

- On Windows, activate the virtual environment by running:

```
    .myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

- On macOS and Linux, activate it with:

```
    source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the package requirements from the requirements.txt by executing the following pip installation command:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_recommended_: Store your API keys in a .env file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>

### You can also look at the .\example_dot_env file in this repo for the structure. Remeber to rename to .env
```

The notebooks in this repository need __python version > 3.11.1__
